1. $ is needed to print vars inside string
   => Console.WriteLine($"Your name is: {name}");
   
2. Verbatim String Prefix @, using this will print single \ as \, \n will be \n
   Console.WriteLine(@"your file is located at: c:\drive\file\dir\file.ext");

3. ?? operator is a thing in c#, just like js

4. type conversions are simpler than java, [ var a = (type) b ]
   or use Convert class.
   
5. Convert.ToBoolean("str") will throw exception, but ide won't show error.
   but this works for numbers and null
   
6.
