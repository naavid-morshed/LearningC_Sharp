1. $ is needed to print vars inside string
   => Console.WriteLine($"Your name is: {name}");
   
2. Verbatim String Prefix @, using this will print single \ as \, \n will be \n
   Console.WriteLine(@"your file is located at: c:\drive\file\dir\file.ext");

3. ?? operator is a thing in c#, just like js

4. type conversions are simpler than java, [ var a = (type) b ]
   or use Convert class.
   
5. Convert.ToBoolean("str") will throw exception, but ide won't show error.
   but this works for numbers and null
   
6. string str = "1500";
   Convert.ToInt32(str); or int.Parse(str);

7. int.TryParse("1500", out var result); 
   => will return true if the string can be converted and result will be that number, if failed 
      then will return false and result will be equal to 0;

8. using LearningC_Sharp.Problems; // is like import in java

9. string.Join(", ", arr) [joins each two element with ", "]

10. ForEach does not work on arrays, need to convert into list
    _arr.ToList().ForEach(Console.Write);
    
11. for loop, same as java. foreach uses "in" to tap into list/arr instead of ":" in java

12. AND and OR operator are &&, ||
    if single | or single & is used then condition will check all the conditions even if the previous conditions fail.
    (I do not see any reason to use single &, |. this opinion may be changed later)
